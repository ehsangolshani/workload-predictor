<em>Calgary-HTTP</em>
</h1>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Description</b>
<dd>
This trace contains approximately one year's worth of all HTTP requests to the University of Calgary's Department of Computer Science WWW server
located at Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
<dt>
<b>Format</b>
<dd>
The logs are an ASCII file with one line per request, with the following
columns:
<ol>
<li><b>host</b> making the request.  Hosts are identified as either 
<b>local </b> or <b>remote </b> where <b>local</b> is a host from the 
University of Calgary, and <b> remote </b> is a host from outside of 
the University of Calgary domain.
<li><b>timestamp</b> in the format "DAY MON DD HH:MM:SS YYYY", where
<b>DAY</b> is the day of the week, <b>MON</b> is the name of the month,
<b>DD</b> is the day of the month, <b>HH:MM:SS</b>
is the time of day using a 24-hour clock, and <b>YYYY</b> is the year.
The timezone is -0700 between 30/Oct/1994:01:30:57 and 02/Apr/1995:03:03:26.  
For all other requests, the timezone is -0600.
<li><b>filename</b> of the requested item.  Paths have been removed.
Modified filenames consist of two parts: <b> num.type </b>, where <b> num </b>
is a unique integer identifier, and <b> type </b> is the extension of
the requested file.
<li><b>HTTP reply code</b>.
<li><b>bytes in the reply</b>.
</ol>
<dt>
<b>Measurement</b>
<dd>
The logs were collected from October 24, 1994 through October 11, 1995,
a total of 353 days.  There were 726,739 requests.  Timestamps have 1 
second resolution.  
<dt>
<b>Privacy</b>
<dd>
The sites making requests to the server have had their addresses removed
to preserve privacy.  Paths have been removed.  Files were numbered from
1 for the first file encountered in the trace. Files retain the original
file extension, so that the type of file can be determined.
