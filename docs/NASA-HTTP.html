<em>NASA-HTTP</em>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>Description</b>
<dd>
These two traces contain two month's worth of all HTTP requests to the 
NASA Kennedy Space Center WWW server in Florida.
<dt>
<b>Format</b>
<dd>
The logs are an ASCII file with one line per request, with the following
columns:
<ol>
<li><b>host</b> making the request.  A hostname when possible, otherwise
the Internet address if the name could not be looked up.
<li><b>timestamp</b> in the format "DAY MON DD HH:MM:SS YYYY", where
<b>DAY</b> is the day of the week, <b>MON</b> is the name of the month,
<b>DD</b> is the day of the month, <b>HH:MM:SS</b>
is the time of day using a 24-hour clock, and <b>YYYY</b> is the year.
The timezone is -0400.
<li><b>request</b> given in quotes.
<li><b>HTTP reply code</b>.
<li><b>bytes in the reply</b>.
</ol>
<dt>
<b>Measurement</b>
<dd>
The first log was collected from 00:00:00 July 1, 1995 through 
23:59:59 July 31, 1995, a total of 31 days.  The second log was 
collected from 00:00:00 August 1, 1995 through 23:59:59 Agust 31, 1995,
a total of 7 days.  In this two week period there were 
3,461,612 requests.  Timestamps have 1 second resolution.  Note that
from 01/Aug/1995:14:52:01 until 03/Aug/1995:04:36:13 there are no accesses
recorded, as the Web server was shut down, due to Hurricane Erin.  
<dt>
<b>Privacy</b>
<dd>
The logs fully preserve the originating host and HTTP request.
